# Project Title: College Website

This project is all about the our college, little website with little specifications.

## Description

I'm excited to build  the college website project to as a part of college project I study web development here. The objective of this project is to design a user-friendly website for my college which will operate as a central location for communication and interaction between students, staff, and visitors.
