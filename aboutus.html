                <p>Well Thought-out Reforms In Technical Education Is The Need Of The Hour" We, in India today,
                    are living in a transitional era. On one hand, we are swamped by the global financial meltdown
                    while on the other; we are witnessing a slow but sure revival of the manufacturing and agricultural
                    sectors.
                    It is evident that highly trained and skilled professionals will be needed in vast numbers to enable
                    our country's
                    transition towards industrial and financial self-sufficiency. In this changing scenario, technology
                    will continue to be a major
                    catalyst for enabling the country's transformation .So the demand for quality technical education in
                    India is huge. - <b>Dr.L Rathaiah</b></p>
